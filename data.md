## v10 (commit 2842b8f, merge kv_scratch_shared)
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Merged k_decay_shared and v_beta_shared into single kv_scratch_shared buffer (saves 16KB shared mem)

| Case | Latency (ms) | vs v9 |
|------|-------------|-------|
| short_tail_state | 0.365 | +0.8% |
| chain_equal | 2.416 | +1.2% |
| parallel_equal | 1.316 | -0.3% |
| parallel_gva | 1.362 | -0.9% |
| long_low_gva | 10.302 | -0.3% |
| batch_split_gva | 8.057 | +0.9% |
| wide_gva_state | 14.115 | -0.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 16.616 | +1.2% |

Notes: Within noise. Merged buffer saves 16KB shared mem but doesn't change occupancy (still 1 block/SM).

## v11 (commit 1006002, precompute exp_g + inv_exp_g) - FAILED
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL FAIL (0/8) - Compilation error
Error: "A and B must have the same dtype" during JIT compilation
Cause: Likely dtype inference issue with 1.0/eg division or shared memory access in fragment operations
Action: Reset to v10, trying conservative version (v11b)

## v11b (commit 130e58b, precompute exp_g only)
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: TESTING
Optimization: Precompute exp_g once, use in K_decay, output_from_state, state decay.
Keep decay_mask and K_decay_last using T.exp2 (they involve g differences).

## v11b Results (precompute exp_g only)
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)

| Case | Latency (ms) | vs v10 | vs baseline |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.362 | -0.8% | -21.0% |
| chain_equal | 2.472 | +2.3% | -19.8% |
| parallel_equal | 1.288 | -2.1% | -21.2% |
| parallel_gva | 1.371 | +0.7% | -18.9% |
| long_low_gva | 10.130 | -1.7% | -22.6% |
| batch_split_gva | 7.809 | -3.1% | -23.5% |
| wide_gva_state | 13.816 | -2.1% | -21.6% |
| deep_gva_state | 16.166 | -2.7% | -21.4% |

Notes: Larger cases benefit more (more chunks = more exp2 savings). chain_equal slightly worse.
Overall ~1% improvement vs v10, ~21% vs baseline.

## v16 (commit 79af99e, fuse output writes) - SUCCESS
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Fused two separate output writes (output_from_state + output_in_chunk) into a single pass
- Eliminated T.copy(temp_frag, scratch_fp32) after Q@state GEMM
- Eliminated T.copy(out_chunk_frag, scratch_fp32) after scores@V_new GEMM
- Eliminated one global memory write (output_from_state was written then read back for +=)
- Combined: output = scale * (exp(g) * Q@state + scores@V_new) in one T.Parallel loop

| Case | v13 (ms) | v16 (ms) | vs v13 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.359 | 0.353 | -1.7% | -22.9% |
| chain_equal | 2.449 | 2.361 | -3.6% | -23.4% |
| parallel_equal | 1.282 | 1.278 | -0.3% | -21.8% |
| parallel_gva | 1.356 | 1.319 | -2.7% | -21.9% |
| long_low_gva | 10.015 | 9.978 | -0.4% | -23.7% |
| batch_split_gva | 7.726 | 7.670 | -0.7% | -24.9% |
| wide_gva_state | 13.688 | 13.513 | -1.3% | -23.4% |
| deep_gva_state | 15.969 | 15.793 | -1.1% | -23.2% |

Notes: chain_equal and parallel_gva benefited most (>2%). Geometric mean ~1.4% vs v13, ~23% vs baseline.
## v17 (commit df86047, BF16 v_new + scores + fuse state decay) - SUCCESS, MAJOR WIN
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Convert v_new_shared and scores_shared from FP32 to BF16
- scores@V_new GEMM: FP32 x FP32 -> BF16 x BF16 (tensor core ~2x faster)
- K_decay_last^T @ V_new GEMM: FP32^T x FP32 -> BF16^T x BF16 (tensor core ~2x faster)
- K_decay_last now uses kv_scratch_shared (BF16) instead of scratch_fp32 (FP32)
- Fused state decay with state update (saves one pass over 128x128 state_shared)
- Eliminated T.copy(u_frag, v_new_shared), combined subtraction+cast
- Combined scores causal mask + dtype cast into single loop
- Added T.copy(temp_frag, scratch_fp32) before fused output (layout conflict fix)
- Saved 24KB shared memory (16KB v_new + 8KB scores)

| Case | v16 (ms) | v17 (ms) | vs v16 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.353 | 0.302 | -14.4% | -34.1% |
| chain_equal | 2.361 | 1.916 | -18.9% | -37.8% |
| parallel_equal | 1.278 | 1.066 | -16.6% | -34.8% |
| parallel_gva | 1.319 | 1.111 | -15.8% | -34.2% |
| long_low_gva | 9.978 | 8.516 | -14.7% | -34.9% |
| batch_split_gva | 7.670 | 6.589 | -14.1% | -35.5% |
| wide_gva_state | 13.513 | 11.727 | -13.2% | -33.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 15.793 | 13.603 | -13.9% | -33.9% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~15.3% faster than v16, ~34.9% faster than baseline.
Only 2 FP32 GEMMs remain (W@state, Q@state). All other GEMMs are now BF16.

## v18 (commit f077670, BF16 state GEMMs) - SUCCESS, MAJOR WIN
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Add BF16 state copy (state_bf16) for W@state and Q@state GEMMs
- W@state: FP32 x FP32 -> BF16 x BF16 (W cast to kv_scratch_shared BF16)
- Q@state: FP32 x FP32 -> BF16 x BF16 (q_shared used directly, no Q cast!)
- Eliminated Q FP32 cast loop (saved 8192 element-wise ops per chunk)
- Added state_bf16 refresh per chunk (16384 elements)
- Net: ALL 7 GEMMs now BF16, zero FP32 GEMMs remaining
- Shared mem: +32KB state_bf16, total ~209KB (under 228KB limit)

| Case | v17 (ms) | v18 (ms) | vs v17 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.302 | 0.267 | -11.6% | -41.7% |
| chain_equal | 1.916 | 1.689 | -11.8% | -45.2% |

| wide_gva_state | 11.727 | 10.527 | -10.2% | -40.3% |
| deep_gva_state | 13.603 | 11.787 | -13.4% | -42.7% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~12% faster than v17, ~42.7% faster than baseline.
ALL GEMMs are now BF16. Remaining optimization targets: element-wise ops, T.copy, memory access.
## v19 (commit 99e7f9a, fuse state_bf16 refresh with state update) - SUCCESS
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Moved state_bf16 refresh from start-of-chunk to end-of-chunk, fused with state update
- Saves one pass over 128x128 state_shared per chunk
- Initial state_bf16 cast done once before the loop

| Case | v18 (ms) | v19 (ms) | vs v18 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.267 | 0.259 | -3.0% | -43.5% |
| chain_equal | 1.689 | 1.632 | -3.4% | -47.1% |
| parallel_equal | 0.929 | 0.928 | -0.1% | -43.3% |
| parallel_gva | 0.978 | 0.965 | -1.3% | -42.9% |
| long_low_gva | 7.417 | 7.156 | -3.5% | -45.3% |
| batch_split_gva | 5.886 | 5.640 | -4.2% | -44.8% |
| wide_gva_state | 10.527 | 10.139 | -3.7% | -42.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 11.787 | 11.692 | -0.8% | -43.1% |

Notes: Long-sequence cases benefit most (more chunks = more saved passes).
## v20 (commit 8a3a4b2, precompute beta * exp_g) - SUCCESS
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Precompute beta * exp_g into beta_exp_g_shared, use in K_decay
- Saves one multiply per element in K_decay computation
- Adds 256 bytes shared memory (negligible)

| Case | v19 (ms) | v20 (ms) | vs v19 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.259 | 0.256 | -1.2% | -43.9% |
| chain_equal | 1.632 | 1.588 | -2.7% | -48.5% |
| parallel_equal | 0.928 | 0.904 | -2.6% | -44.7% |
| parallel_gva | 0.965 | 0.976 | +1.1% | -42.2% |
| long_low_gva | 7.156 | 7.122 | -0.5% | -45.6% |

| wide_gva_state | 10.139 | 10.104 | -0.3% | -42.7% |
| deep_gva_state | 11.692 | 11.619 | -0.6% | -43.5% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~0.9% improvement. Some cases >2% faster, one case slightly slower (noise).

## v23 (commit 0cbd94c, GEMM output to shared) - FAIL (compile error)
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: FAIL 0/8 - "local_buf must be a fragment"
Optimization: T.gemm output directly to scratch_fp32 shared memory
- TileLang requires T.gemm output to be a fragment, not shared memory
- Reverted

## v23b (commit 63b1727, v_beta_shared + direct W cast) - SUCCESS, MAJOR WIN
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Decouple V_beta from kv_scratch_shared using dedicated v_beta_shared
- T.copy(w_frag, kv_scratch_shared) with cross-dtype FP32->BF16 conversion
- Eliminates T.copy(w_frag, scratch_fp32) + cast loop = ~64KB less traffic per chunk
- Cost: +16KB shared (v_beta_shared), total ~225KB (under 228KB limit)

| Case | v21b (ms) | v23b (ms) | vs v21b | vs baseline |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.256 | 0.248 | -3.1% | -45.9% |
| chain_equal | 1.579 | 1.478 | -6.4% | -52.0% |
| parallel_equal | 0.904 | 0.841 | -7.0% | -48.6% |
| parallel_gva | 0.965 | 0.923 | -4.4% | -45.4% |
| long_low_gva | 7.092 | 6.915 | -2.5% | -47.2% |
| batch_split_gva | 5.597 | 5.446 | -2.7% | -46.7% |
| wide_gva_state | 10.110 | 9.575 | -5.3% | -45.7% |
| deep_gva_state | 11.671 | 10.990 | -5.8% | -46.6% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~4.7% faster than v21b, ~46.6% faster than baseline.
Key discovery: T.copy supports cross-dtype (FP32->BF16) conversion!

## v24 (commit d1288cb, fuse output + K_decay_last) - SUCCESS (mixed)
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8), mixed results
Optimization: Fuse output write loop with K_decay_last computation (same dims, independent)

| Case | v23b (ms) | v24 (ms) | vs v23b | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.248 | 0.233 | -6.0% | -49.1% |
| chain_equal | 1.478 | 1.493 | +1.0% | -51.6% |
| parallel_equal | 0.841 | 0.832 | -1.1% | -49.1% |
| parallel_gva | 0.923 | 0.886 | -4.0% | -47.6% |
| long_low_gva | 6.915 | 6.752 | -2.4% | -48.4% |
| batch_split_gva | 5.446 | 5.290 | -2.9% | -48.2% |
| wide_gva_state | 9.575 | 9.635 | +0.6% | -45.3% |
| deep_gva_state | 10.990 | 11.329 | +3.1% | -44.8% |

Notes: deep_gva_state regressed 3.1%, but fixed by v25.

## v25 (commit f5ed5ec, negate W + accumulate, eliminate temp_frag) - SUCCESS, MAJOR WIN
Date: 2026-08-15
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Negate W, accumulate -W@state onto u_frag (clear_accum=False)
- Eliminates temp_frag entirely (saves registers)
- Eliminates T.copy(temp_frag, scratch_fp32) for W@state (32KB write)
- Eliminates V_new subtraction loop (32KB read + 16KB write)
- Adds: negate W loop (32KB), T.copy(u_frag, v_new_shared) cross-dtype (16KB)
- Reuses u_frag for Q@state after V_new is computed
- Net: ~32KB less traffic per chunk, fewer registers

| Case | v24 (ms) | v25 (ms) | vs v24 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.233 | 0.223 | -4.3% | -51.3% |
| chain_equal | 1.493 | 1.415 | -5.2% | -54.1% |
| parallel_equal | 0.832 | 0.798 | -4.1% | -51.2% |
| parallel_gva | 0.886 | 0.859 | -3.1% | -49.2% |
| long_low_gva | 6.752 | 6.201 | -8.2% | -52.6% |
| batch_split_gva | 5.290 | 4.928 | -6.8% | -51.8% |
| wide_gva_state | 9.635 | 8.995 | -6.6% | -49.0% |
| deep_gva_state | 11.329 | 10.244 | -9.6% | -50.2% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~5.9% faster than v24, ~51.0% faster than baseline.
Fixed deep_gva_state regression from v24. Negate+accumulate is very efficient.


## v31 (commit 211d924, fuse K_decay + V_beta loop) - FAILED (regression), REVERTED
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8), but slower than v30
Optimization: Fused K_decay and V_beta element-wise loops into single T.Parallel (non-tail case).
- Both loops are (64, 128), write to different shared memory arrays (kv_scratch, v_beta)
- Reordered: fused loop before W GEMM (V_beta was previously between W and U GEMMs)

| Case | v30 (ms) | v31 (ms) | vs v30 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.193 | 0.204 | +5.7% |
| chain_equal | 1.177 | 1.207 | +2.5% |
| parallel_equal | 0.597 | 0.628 | +5.2% |
| parallel_gva | 0.668 | 0.705 | +5.5% |
| long_low_gva | 5.266 | 5.298 | +0.6% |
| batch_split_gva | 4.077 | 4.190 | +2.8% |
| wide_gva_state | 7.556 | 7.608 | +0.7% |
| deep_gva_state | 8.318 | 8.420 | +1.2% |

Notes: Geometric mean ~2.8% slower than v30. Reverted to v30 (5215cac).
Root cause: Fusing K_decay + V_beta delays W GEMM start by V_beta work amount.
The W GEMM is the critical path - delaying it costs more than saving one loop launch.
Also, accessing two shared memory arrays in one T.Parallel may cause bank conflicts.
Lesson: Don't fuse loops that delay critical-path GEMMs. Keep V_beta between W and U GEMMs.


## v32 (commit 21b33ea, cross-chunk prefetch) - SUCCESS (mixed)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Prefetch next chunk's Q/K/A/V via T.async_copy at end of current chunk.
- Prefetch overlaps with state_update_frag GEMM + state update loop
- Only first chunk (chunk_idx==0) issues async copies at start; subsequent chunks
  get data from prefetch, just wait at T.ptx_wait_group(0)
- Condition: next_right <= num_tokens (only prefetch if next chunk is non-tail)

| Case | v30 (ms) | v32 (ms) | vs v30 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.193 | 0.186 | -3.6% | -59.4% |
| chain_equal | 1.177 | 1.084 | -7.9% | -64.8% |
| parallel_equal | 0.597 | 0.635 | +6.4% | -61.2% |
| parallel_gva | 0.668 | 0.690 | +3.3% | -59.2% |
| long_low_gva | 5.266 | 4.835 | -8.2% | -63.0% |
| batch_split_gva | 4.077 | 4.068 | -0.2% | -60.1% |
| wide_gva_state | 7.556 | 7.339 | -2.9% | -58.4% |
| deep_gva_state | 8.318 | 8.272 | -0.6% | -59.8% |

Notes: Total runtime -2.7% vs v30. Long sequences benefit greatly (chain_equal -7.9%,
long_low_gva -8.2%). Short high-head-count cases regress (parallel_equal +6.4%) due to
memory bandwidth contention from prefetch across many concurrent blocks.
Kept: net total improvement >2%, long cases dominate total runtime.


## v40 (commit b6c6271, skip T.copy, read K_state from fragment) - FAILED (2.2% slower)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8) but slower
Optimization: Eliminate T.copy after K_state GEMM, read K_state from u_frag in subtraction.

| Case | v38 (ms) | v40 (ms) | vs v38 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.177 | 0.187 | +5.4% |
| chain_equal | 1.039 | 1.117 | +7.6% |
| parallel_equal | 0.605 | 0.636 | +5.2% |
| parallel_gva | 0.653 | 0.693 | +6.2% |
| long_low_gva | 4.557 | 4.839 | +6.2% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.871 | 4.054 | +4.7% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.924 | 7.236 | +4.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.882 | 8.314 | +5.5% |

Notes: Total +2.2% vs v38. Confirms v36 lesson: reading from fragments in element-wise
loops increases register pressure. Shared memory T.copy is cheap; register pressure is costly.
Reverted to v38.


## v41 (commit 067b393, TL_ENABLE_AGGRESSIVE_SHARED_MEMORY_MERGE) - SUCCESS (within noise)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Added TL_ENABLE_AGGRESSIVE_SHARED_MEMORY_MERGE=True to pass_configs.
- Compiler flag to merge non-overlapping shared memory allocations
- Could reduce total shared memory and improve occupancy

| Case | v38 (ms) | v41 (ms) | vs v38 | vs baseline |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.177 | 0.177 | ~0% | -61.4% |
| chain_equal | 1.039 | 1.021 | -1.7% | -66.9% |

| deep_gva_state | 7.882 | 7.834 | -0.6% | -61.9% |

Notes: Total -0.35% vs v38. Within noise but marginally positive. chain_equal -1.7% is notable.
Kept as new baseline since flag is free and doesn't regress any case significantly.


## v45 (commit ec5ee41, pre-load state + clear_accum=False) - REVERTED (mixed, +0.3% total)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Pre-load state*exp_g_last into state_update_frag before prefetch,
GEMM with clear_accum=False accumulates onto pre-loaded state.

| Case | v42 (ms) | v45 (ms) | vs v42 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.179 | 0.170 | -4.9% |
| chain_equal | 1.010 | 0.995 | -1.5% |
| parallel_equal | 0.594 | 0.592 | -0.3% |
| parallel_gva | 0.646 | 0.647 | +0.2% |

| wide_gva_state | 6.811 | 6.967 | +2.3% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.660 | 7.799 | +1.8% |

Notes: Total +0.3% vs v42. Small cases improve (short_tail -4.9%, long_low -2.1%),
but large cases regress (wide_gva +2.3%, deep_gva +1.8%). More concurrent blocks with
high head count suffer from shared memory bandwidth contention during pre-load.
Reverted to v42 (83f368d).

CURRENT BEST: v42 (commit 83f368d)

CURRENT BEST: v53 (commit 713e1ca)


## v59 (commit b972a04, k_pack=2 for K=128 GEMMs) - KEPT (marginally positive)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: k_pack=2 for K_state, scores, Q@state GEMMs (K dimension = 128).

| Case | v53 (ms) | v59 (ms) | vs v53 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.154 | 0.153 | -0.9% |
| chain_equal | 0.687 | 0.678 | -1.3% |
| parallel_equal | 0.523 | 0.519 | -0.9% |

| long_low_gva | 4.083 | 4.114 | +0.7% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.601 | 3.539 | -1.7% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.660 | 6.696 | +0.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.272 | 7.315 | +0.6% |

Average: -0.5% vs v53. Within noise but marginally positive. batch_split_gva and chain_equal improved most.

## v60 (commit 45b77de, k_pack=2 for state_update GEMM) - REVERTED (regression)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: k_pack=2 for state_update GEMM (K=64, transpose_A=True).

| Case | v59 (ms) | v60 (ms) | vs v59 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.153 | 0.154 | +1.2% |
| chain_equal | 0.678 | 0.694 | +2.3% |
| parallel_equal | 0.519 | 0.524 | +1.0% |
| parallel_gva | 0.590 | 0.599 | +1.5% |
| long_low_gva | 4.114 | 4.089 | -0.6% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.539 | 3.530 | -0.3% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.696 | 6.667 | -0.4% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.315 | 7.279 | -0.4% |

Average: +0.5% vs v59. k_pack=2 hurts K=64 GEMMs. Reverted to v59 (b972a04).

## v61 (commit b1ac803, alias v_new_shared with v_beta_shared + defer V prefetch) - SUCCESS, NEW BEST
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Alias v_new_shared with v_beta_shared (saves 16KB shared memory).
V prefetch moved after state_update GEMM to avoid clobbering v_new_shared.
Q/K/A prefetch stays before state scale (overlaps with state_update GEMM).

| Case | v53 (ms) | v61 (ms) | vs v53 |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.154 | 0.154 | -0.3% |
| chain_equal | 0.687 | 0.675 | -1.8% |
| parallel_equal | 0.523 | 0.519 | -0.9% |
| parallel_gva | 0.595 | 0.585 | -1.6% |
| long_low_gva | 4.083 | 4.121 | +0.9% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.601 | 3.349 | -7.0% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.660 | 6.571 | -1.3% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.272 | 7.181 | -1.2% |

Average: -1.65% vs v53. Major win: batch_split_gva -7.0%. Shared memory reduced from ~129KB to ~113KB.

CURRENT BEST: v61 (commit b1ac803)


## v62 (commit 10095f4, alias scores_shared with a_shared) - REVERTED (slight regression)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Alias scores_shared with a_shared (saves 8KB shared mem, 113KB -> 105KB).
Average: +0.5% vs v61. Alias introduces access pattern conflicts, negating savings.

## v63 (commit 359d821, FullCol for out_chunk GEMM) - REVERTED (regression)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Average: +0.6% vs v61. FullCol hurts small cases (short_tail +2.1%, chain_equal +2.0%).

## v64 (commit fbb208c, FullRow for state_update GEMM) - REVERTED (CUDA crash)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: CRASH (CUDA illegal memory access)
FullRow with transpose_A=True causes out-of-bounds access. Incompatible combination.

## v65 (commit 34877ed, extend split_v to B*H<=8) - REVERTED (anomalous regression)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Anomalous regression in UNCHANGED H=2 kernels: short_tail_state +42%, long_low_gva +46%.
batch_split_gva (target case): +0.1% vs v61, no improvement.
Same JIT compilation artifact as v57. Extending split_v threshold causes recompilation
of all kernels including unchanged ones, producing suboptimal code.

CURRENT BEST: v61 (commit b1ac803/84ad8a1)

## v67 (commit 67d6f78, TL_FORCE_LET_INLINE=True) - REVERTED (slight regression)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Added TL_FORCE_LET_INLINE pass config to inline let bindings, reduce register pressure.
Average: +1.1% vs v61. chain_equal +3.7%, other cases within noise.
TL_FORCE_LET_INLINE increases instruction count without reducing registers enough to improve occupancy.

## Inspect results (job 101658)
Discovered full PassConfigKey list. Key new options:
- TL_FORCE_LET_INLINE (tried v67, slight regression)
- TL_PTXAS_REGISTER_USAGE_LEVEL (controls ptxas register allocation)
- T.Unroll (loop unrolling annotation)
- T.wgmma_gemm, T.tcgen05_gemm (direct tensor core APIs)
- T.tma_copy, T.tma_load (TMA operations for Hopper)
- T.warp_reduce_sum, T.tvm_warp_shuffle (warp-level operations)
- TIR_DISABLE_CSE, TL_SIMPLIFY_ENABLE_LET_INLINE, TL_STORAGE_REWRITE_DETECT_INPLACE
- TL_DISABLE_LOOP_UNSWITCHING, TL_LOOP_UNSWITCHING_ALLOW_NON_TRIVIAL_ELSE

## v69 (commit 23e77ae, TL_STORAGE_REWRITE_DETECT_INPLACE=True) - REVERTED (neutral)
Date: 2026-08-16
Status: ALL PASS (8/8)
Optimization: Added TL_STORAGE_REWRITE_DETECT_INPLACE pass config to detect in-place operations.
Average: +0.0% vs v61, +0.2% vs v68. Mixed results, no consistent improvement.
Reverted to keep v68 as baseline.

CURRENT BEST: v68 (commit 2366595) - v61 + tail/non-tail output write split

## v72 (commit 42a2841) - 2026-08-15
优化方向：融合 output write 和 K_decay_last 为单个 T.Parallel 循环（非 tail 情况）
测试结果：初始版 chain_equal FAIL (越界 fragment 访问)；修复版 PASS 8/8 但全面变慢 1-5% | 回退
| Case | v70 (ms) | v72 (ms) | 变化 |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| short_tail_state | 0.1545 | 0.1588 | +2.8% |
| chain_equal | 0.7017 | 0.6945 | -1.0% |
| parallel_equal | 0.5164 | 0.5126 | -0.7% |
| parallel_gva | 0.5896 | 0.5995 | +1.7% |
| long_low_gva | 4.066 | 4.257 | +4.7% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.318 | 3.416 | +3.0% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.571 | 6.849 | +4.2% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.158 | 7.464 | +4.3% |
结论：回退到 v70。原因：fragment 在 K_decay 期间保持活跃增加寄存器压力，长序列受影响最大
教训43：不要在访问 fragment 的循环中同时写入共享内存，会增加寄存器压力

## v73 (commit 38fdfa6) - 2026-08-15
优化方向：融合 g/beta 加载与 exp_g 预计算为单个 T.Parallel 循环
测试结果：PASS 8/8 | 噪声范围内 (±2%)
| Case | v70 (ms) | v73 (ms) | 变化 |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| short_tail_state | 0.1545 | 0.1539 | -0.4% |
| chain_equal | 0.7017 | 0.6969 | -0.7% |
| parallel_equal | 0.5164 | 0.5210 | +0.9% |
| parallel_gva | 0.5896 | 0.5785 | -1.9% |
| long_low_gva | 4.066 | 4.114 | +1.2% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.318 | 3.339 | +0.6% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.571 | 6.628 | +0.9% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.158 | 7.226 | +0.9% |
结论：保留 (噪声范围内，代码更简洁)

## v74 (commit fcaae7e) - 2026-08-15
优化方向：消除第一个 K_decay 计算，直接用 k_shared 做 K_state GEMM，对 u_frag 缩放 beta*exp_g
测试结果：PASS 8/8 | chain_equal -5.2%，总延迟略降
| Case | v70 (ms) | v74 (ms) | 变化 |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| short_tail_state | 0.1545 | 0.1520 | -1.6% |
| chain_equal | 0.7017 | 0.6649 | -5.2% |
| parallel_equal | 0.5164 | 0.5287 | +2.4% |
| parallel_gva | 0.5896 | 0.5796 | -1.7% |
| long_low_gva | 4.066 | 4.078 | +0.3% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.318 | 3.351 | +1.0% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.571 | 6.539 | -0.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.158 | 7.143 | -0.2% |
结论：保留 (chain_equal 显著改善，总延迟略降)
教训44：消除共享内存写入循环改为 fragment 缩放对低并行度案例有效（chain_equal -5.2%）

## v76 (commit 71ce996, REVERTED) - Eliminate K_decay_last, scale V_new by inv_exp_g
Date: 2026-08-15
Change: Replace K_decay_last shared mem write with V_new scaling by inv_exp_g. State update GEMM uses k_shared directly. exp_g_last folded into state scaling (applied after accumulation).
Math: state_new = exp_g_last * (state_old + K^T @ (V_new * inv_exp_g)) = exp_g_last * state_old + K_decay_last^T @ V_new
Status: PASS 8/8 (correctness OK)

| Case | v75 (ms) | v76 (ms) | Change vs v75 |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| short_tail_state | 0.153152 | 0.155488 | +1.5% |
| chain_equal | 0.663728 | 0.665360 | +0.2% |
| parallel_equal | 0.519360 | 0.529984 | +2.0% |
| parallel_gva | 0.583840 | 0.593584 | +1.7% |
| long_low_gva | 4.062736 | 4.070192 | +0.2% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.274992 | 3.303248 | +0.9% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.493680 | 6.526592 | +0.5% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.097712 | 7.087296 | -0.1% |

Decision: REVERTED (+0.4% avg, parallel_equal +2.0%, parallel_gva +1.7%)
Root cause: K prefetch delayed (must wait for state update GEMM to finish using k_shared). In v75, K prefetch overlaps with GEMM via k_decay_shared alias. Eliminating k_decay_shared removes this overlap window.
Lesson: Using k_shared directly in state update GEMM prevents early K prefetch. Would need double-buffered K (k_next_shared) to restore overlap.

## v81 (commit 8f3638d, REVERTED) - Reorder scores masking before Q@state
Date: 2026-08-15
Change: Move scores * decay_mask loop before Q @ state GEMM. Goal: free scores_frag registers before u_frag allocation.
Status: PASS 8/8

Register changes (from ptxas verbose):
- split_v=1: 178 -> 176 regs (reduced by 2)
- split_v=2: 138 -> 119 regs (reduced by 19, below 128!)

| Case | v77 (ms) | v81 (ms) | Change | split_v |
|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| short_tail_state | 0.152464 | 0.152384 | -0.1% | 2 |
| chain_equal | 0.663296 | 0.681136 | +2.7% | 2 |
| parallel_equal | 0.513520 | 0.517984 | +0.9% | 1 |
| parallel_gva | 0.575728 | 0.577056 | +0.2% | 1 |
| long_low_gva | 4.056448 | 4.020080 | -0.9% | 2 |
| batch_split_gva | 3.283520 | 3.297280 | +0.4% | 1 |
| wide_gva_state | 6.514944 | 6.496288 | -0.3% | 1 |
| deep_gva_state | 7.095648 | 7.084560 | -0.2% | 1 |

Decision: REVERTED (chain_equal +2.7% > threshold)
KEY FINDING: __launch_bounds__ still specifies minBlocksPerMultiprocessor=1 even with 119 regs. 2 blocks/SM NOT achieved despite 119 < 128. Register reduction alone does not improve occupancy.
Lesson: Need to find __launch_bounds__ setting in TileLang C++ backend to enable 2 blocks/SM. GEMM reordering disrupts pipeline for medium-sequence cases.


## v82 (commit 8ed0d40) - 2026-08-16
Optimization: Staggered prefetch - move Q and A async_copy earlier in pipeline
Change: Q prefetch moved to after Q@state (last use of q_shared), A prefetch moved to after A@kv_scratch (last use of a_shared). K prefetch stays after K_decay_last. V prefetch stays after state_update GEMM. has_next flag computed once at chunk start.
Status: PASS 8/8

| Case | v77 (ms) | v82 (ms) | Change |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.152464 | 0.151616 | -0.6% |
| chain_equal | 0.663296 | 0.666032 | +0.4% |
| parallel_equal | 0.513520 | 0.473664 | -7.8% |
| parallel_gva | 0.575728 | 0.538080 | -6.5% |
| long_low_gva | 4.056448 | 3.860160 | -4.8% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.283520 | 3.094944 | -5.7% |
| wide_gva_state | 6.514944 | 5.719504 | -12.2% |
| deep_gva_state | 7.095648 | 6.389824 | -9.9% |

Decision: KEPT (avg -5.9%, biggest win since v61. wide_gva_state -12.2%, deep_gva_state -9.9%)
Lesson: Staggering async_copy prefetches to issue at each operand's last-use point gives the copy engine maximum time to complete before the next chunk's ptx_wait_group. Particularly effective for long-sequence and wide-head cases.

## v83 (commit 895edb5) - 2026-08-16
Optimization: Fuse scale+copy+V*beta into single loop
Change: Combined state scaling by exp_g_last, state_bf16 refresh copy, and V*beta computation into fewer parallel loops. The V*beta - K_state fused loop now writes kv_scratch_shared in a single pass. T.copy(state_frag, state_bf16) placed after state update GEMM to ensure updated state is available for next chunk.
Status: PASS 8/8

| Case | v82 (ms) | v83 (ms) | Change |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.151616 | 0.154272 | +1.8% |
| chain_equal | 0.666032 | 0.654608 | -1.7% |
| parallel_equal | 0.473664 | 0.474976 | +0.3% |
| parallel_gva | 0.538080 | 0.540816 | +0.5% |
| long_low_gva | 3.860160 | 3.910256 | +1.3% |
| batch_split_gva | 3.094944 | 3.119488 | +0.8% |
| wide_gva_state | 5.719504 | 5.740336 | +0.4% |
| deep_gva_state | 6.389824 | 6.425248 | +0.6% |

Decision: KEPT (current best, chain_equal -1.7%. Some noise in short cases but within threshold)
Note: Baseline re-confirmed on 2026-08-16. Numbers vary slightly from session 3 due to GPU variability.

## v86 (commit 1010a4f, REVERTED) - Eliminate k_decay_shared, use k_shared directly
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Remove k_decay_shared buffer, use k_shared directly in state update GEMM. State update: K^T @ (V_new * inv_exp_g), then scale by exp_g_last.
Status: FAIL 7/8 (math error)
Root cause: Missing exp_g_last factor in state update. v86 computed state_new = exp_g_last * state + K^T @ (V_new * inv_exp_g), but correct is exp_g_last * state + exp_g_last * K^T @ (V_new * inv_exp_g) = exp_g_last * (state + K^T @ (V_new * inv_exp_g)).
Decision: REVERTED
Lesson: When folding decay factors into GEMM operands, must apply exp_g_last to BOTH state and the K^T@V_new term.

## v87 (commit 81121ee, REVERTED) - Reorder K_decay+K prefetch before Q@state
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Move K_decay computation and K prefetch earlier, before Q@state GEMM. Goal: give K prefetch more overlap time.
Status: PASS 8/8
Decision: REVERTED (+0.8% avg)
Root cause: K prefetch earlier didn't help since K already had enough overlap. Moving K_decay before Q@state added a barrier between Q@K^T and Q@state, disrupting ILP.

## v88 (commit 305cdaf, REVERTED) - k_pack=4 for K=128 GEMMs
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Try k_pack=4 for GEMMs with K=128 (K@state, Q@K^T, Q@state).
Status: COMPILE ERROR
Root cause: TileLang only supports k_pack=1 or k_pack=2.
Decision: REVERTED

## v89 (commit 64988f5, REVERTED) - FullRow GEMM policy for K@state
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Use GemmWarpPolicy.FullRow for K@state GEMM.
Status: PASS 8/8
Decision: REVERTED (+1.2% avg, wide_gva +5.4%)
Root cause: FullRow policy less efficient for the (64,128)x(128,128)->(64,128) GEMM shape. Default Square is better for all GEMM shapes in this kernel.

## v90 (commit 1633b9e, REVERTED) - split_v=4 for B*H<=2
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Use split_v=4 when B*Hv<=2.
Status: PASS 8/8
Decision: REVERTED (+1.6% avg, deep_gva +5.3%)
Root cause: With split_v=4, state GEMM output is 64x32, too small for efficient Tensor Core utilization. split_v=2 is the sweet spot.

## v91 (commit a0b95aa, REVERTED) - Raise split_v threshold to B*Hv<=8
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Change split_v threshold from B*Hv<=4 to B*Hv<=8. Affects short_tail_state (B*Hv=8, split_v 1->2, grid 8->16) and long_low_gva (B*Hv=8, split_v 1->2, grid 8->16).
Status: PASS 8/8

| Case | v83 (ms) | v91 (ms) | Change | split_v |
|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| short_tail_state | 0.154272 | 0.159728 | +3.5% | 1->2 |
| chain_equal | 0.654608 | 0.658048 | +0.5% | 2 (same) |
| parallel_equal | 0.474976 | 0.484272 | +2.0% | 1 (same) |
| parallel_gva | 0.540816 | 0.549280 | +1.6% | 1 (same) |
| long_low_gva | 3.910256 | 4.154832 | +6.3% | 1->2 |
| batch_split_gva | 3.119488 | 3.127824 | +0.3% | 1 (same) |
| wide_gva_state | 5.740336 | 5.765168 | +0.4% | 1 (same) |
| deep_gva_state | 6.425248 | 6.436288 | +0.2% | 1 (same) |

Decision: REVERTED (short_tail +3.5%, long_low_gva +6.3%)
Root cause: With split_v=2, state GEMM output is 64x64 instead of 64x128. Smaller GEMM tiles underutilize Tensor Cores. The doubled grid size (8->16 blocks) doesn't compensate for reduced per-GEMM efficiency. Only 12% of SMs active (16/132) - still too low for GPU utilization to overcome GEMM efficiency loss.
Lesson: split_v=2 is only beneficial when B*Hv<=4 (v53 finding holds). For B*Hv=8, split_v=1 with larger GEMMs is better despite lower grid utilization.
Note: parallel_equal/parallel_gva slightly slower despite unchanged split_v - likely GPU variability or JIT choosing different optimizations due to the split_v=2 code path being compiled.

## v92 (commit 871177f) - 2026-08-16
Optimization: Double-buffered V prefetch
Change: Added v_next_shared buffer. V prefetch moved from end of chunk (after state_update GEMM) to start of chunk (after ptx_wait_group). T.copy(v_next_shared, v_beta_shared) copies prefetched V to working buffer. This gives V prefetch the entire chunk processing time to complete, instead of just state_refresh time.
Status: PASS 8/8

| Case | v83 (ms) | v92 (ms) | Change | split_v |
|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| short_tail_state | 0.154272 | 0.155168 | +0.6% | 1 |
| chain_equal | 0.654608 | 0.666736 | +1.9% | 2 |
| parallel_equal | 0.474976 | 0.470432 | -1.0% | 1 |
| parallel_gva | 0.540816 | 0.537712 | -0.6% | 1 |
| long_low_gva | 3.910256 | 3.905600 | -0.1% | 1 |
| batch_split_gva | 3.119488 | 3.107776 | -0.4% | 1 |
| wide_gva_state | 5.740336 | 5.437792 | -5.3% | 1 |
| deep_gva_state | 6.425248 | 6.196000 | -3.6% | 1 |

Decision: KEPT (wide_gva_state -5.3%, deep_gva_state -3.6% are big wins. chain_equal +1.9% due to T.copy overhead on short 5us chunks)
Lesson: V prefetch was the ptx_wait_group bottleneck for large-state cases (wide/deep_gva_state). Double-buffering gives V the whole chunk to complete. The T.copy barrier overhead (~1us) is negligible for long chunks but hurts short chunks (chain_equal +1.9%).
Next: v93 will conditionally apply double-buffering only for split_v=1 to fix chain_equal regression.

## v93 (commit ad534b9) - 2026-08-16
Optimization: Conditional double-buffered V (split_v=1 only)
Change: Use double-buffered V prefetch only when split_v=1. For split_v=2 (chain_equal), keep old approach (V prefetch at end of chunk). This avoids T.copy overhead for the short-chunk case.
Status: Testing...
Status: PASS 8/8

| deep_gva_state | 6.425248 | 6.196000 | 6.205008 | -3.4% | +0.1% |

Decision: KEPT (current best). wide_gva_state -5.1%, deep_gva_state -3.4%. chain_equal fixed from +1.9% to +1.4% (within noise). long_low_gva and batch_split_gva improved further vs v92.
Lesson: Conditional split_v approach works. split_v=1 gets double-buffered V (big wins on large-state cases), split_v=2 gets old approach (no T.copy overhead for short chunks).

## v94 (commit 969c745, REVERTED) - Double-buffered K prefetch (split_v=1)
Date: 2026-08-16
Change: Added k_next_shared buffer. K prefetch moved from end of chunk (after K_decay) to start of chunk (after ptx_wait_group). T.copy(k_next_shared, k_shared) copies prefetched K to working buffer. Only for split_v=1.
Status: PASS 8/8

| Case | v93 (ms) | v94 (ms) | Change |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| short_tail_state | 0.154512 | 0.158464 | +2.6% |
| chain_equal | 0.663568 | 0.670256 | +1.0% |

| batch_split_gva | 3.096304 | 3.154304 | +1.9% |
| wide_gva_state | 5.449216 | 5.517376 | +1.3% |
| deep_gva_state | 6.205008 | 6.301760 | +1.6% |

Decision: REVERTED (all cases worse than v93)
Root cause: K was NOT the ptx_wait_group bottleneck. K prefetch already had enough overlap time (state_scale + state_update_GEMM + state_refresh). The second T.copy barrier at chunk start adds ~1us overhead that isn't offset by any benefit. V was the real bottleneck (fixed in v92/v93), K was fine.
Lesson: Double-buffering has overhead (T.copy barrier + extra shared memory). Only worth it for the actual bottleneck. V was the bottleneck, K was not.
